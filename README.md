# RoadSafe: A Machine Learning based-Road Accident Prevention System
The system collects driver's information and road condition to predict the accident severity along the route, in order to prevent the accident from happening.
# Data
Data used to train the machine learning algorithms is from Department of Transport UK. Avaiable at: https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data.
# Code
Code includes both the code of building the models and interactive map. The models were fully buit using Python. The interative map was build using Python package Django.
